                <h1>Welcome to my little Website!</h1>
                <p>I know that this font isn't the greatest for this site but for my purposes it's fine. It looks even worse on a screen without IPS Panel.</p>
                <p>
                    So I am writing this site, because I wanted a page, which shows what my Projects are and tell a little bit about me.
                    This site is also kind of a little project of mine. I just was motivated enough to create another site, that actually shows
                    up on the web, thanks to Github Pages. If you have any changes you would recomment, feel free to make a pull request or contact me.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Soo, hello there!</p>
                    <p>
                        I am a german student, that likes to code and to make little projects. I'm currently 19 years old and 
                        soon i'll go to university (if I finish my A-Levels). I have many hobbies and things to do, so I
                        don't have that much time to work on my projects. I am also into Gaming and building PCs and stuff like that.
                        Besides that I play an instrument and I'm a voluntarily firefighter. I also like shooting at a shooting range.
                        At school I'm trying to learn spanisch because I just like the vibe of it.
                    </p>
